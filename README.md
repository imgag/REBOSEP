## **REBOSEP**: REgion BOundary Specific Expression Patterns
REBOSEP is a workflow designed for detecting gene expression patterns across tissue boundaries using spatial transcriptomics data. REBOSEP supports tissue boundary identification and reports gene expression as a function of boundary distance. 
We have included a resource of gene expression patterns across five different brain-meninges boundaries in the developing mouse brain: dorsal pallium - meninges, midbrain - meninges, lower hindbrain - meninges, upper hindbrain - meninges, subpallium - meninges.

## Resource
The gene expression profiles of five boundary regions can be downloaded from [resource](https://github.com/imgag/REBOSEP/resource).

## Tool
### Installation
REBOSEP can be installed using pip:
`pip install rebosep`
